        <p>
            The website continues here.
            However, <b>if you are scared</b> you may <a href="index.html">click here to go back.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Otherwise, as promised, here's a <i>cookie</i>:</p>

        <!-- 
            The img tag is used to display images!
            The alt attribute is used to provide a description of the image if it can't be seen.

        <em>Mmmmmm... delicious.</em>


        <!-- There are 3 different types of lists that can be used: -->

        <!-- Ordered lists use the <ol> tag. <li> is used for each list item: -->
        <h3>Here is an <u>Ordered List</u> of why you should accept this cookie:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I am offering it to you.</li>
            <li>It is now yours.</li>
            <li>Please take it or I will be sad.</li>
            <li>Mmm chobolate choclate chib.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Unordered lists use the <ul> tag. <li> is used for each list item: -->
        <h3>Here is an <u>Unordered List</u> of why you should ignore cookie haters:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They're dumb.</li>
            <li>Stupid.</li>
            <li>Number of cookies owned is proportionate to IQ.</li>
            <li>They stole my dog.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 
            Definition lists use the <dl> tag.
            <dt> is used for each term, and <dd> is used for each definition: 
        -->
        <h3>Finally, here is a <u>Definition List</u> of some key cookie aspects:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Cookie Base</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                The base cookie itself.
                Made from cookie dough baked with love.
                So crumbly and incredibly tasty.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Chocolate Chocolate Chips</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Each chip makes the cookie transcend another plane of existence.
                Far beyond all known measures of scrumptiousness does the cookie now sit.
                This cookie is definitely more than the sum of its parts.

            Tables are defined using the <table> tag.
            <tr> defines a new row.
            <th> defines a header cell, and <td> defines a data cell.
            The colspan and rowspan attributes can be used to make cells bigger.
            <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> can be used to split the table into sections.

            HTML tables should only be used to display static information, as they are
            difficult to modify and there are many better alternatives.
