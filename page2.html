        <!-- There are 3 different types of lists that can be used: -->

        <!-- Ordered lists use the <ol> tag: -->
        <h3>Here is an <u>Ordered List</u> of why you should accept this cookie:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I am offering it to you.</li>
            <li>It is now yours.</li>
            <li>Please take it or I will be sad.</li>
            <li>Mmm chobolate choclate chib.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Unordered lists use the <ul> tag: -->
        <h3>Here is an <u>Unordered List</u> of why you should ignore cookie haters:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They're dumb.</li>
            <li>Stupid.</li>
            <li>Number of cookies owned is proportionate to IQ.</li>
            <li>They stole my dog.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Definition lists use the <dl> tag: -->
        <h3>Finally, here is a <u>Definition List</u> of some key cookie aspects:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Cookie Base</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                The base cookie itself.
                Made from cookie dough baked with love.
                So crumbly and incredibly tasty.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Chocolate Chocolate Chips</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Each chip makes the cookie transcend another plane of existence.
                Far beyond all known measures of scrumptiousness does the cookie now sit.
                This cookie is definitely more than the sum of its parts.
            </dd>
        </dl>
